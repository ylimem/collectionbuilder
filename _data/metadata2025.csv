The photograph depicts the cannon at the University of Guelph. The cannon is painted black with text in yellow spray paint - ""CORONA"" and ""COVID-19"" - as well as bio-hazard symbols. A popular landmark on the University of Guelph campus, the cannon (also known as ""Old Jeremiah"") is regularly painted with announcements and celebratory words by students and faculty members at the University. An unknown student started the tradition in the 1950s. Often, the cannon is painted at night and guarded to ensure no one paints over it before it can be revealed to the campus community the next day. In 2011, artist and Master of Fine Arts graduate Dawn Johnson, removed the layers of paint left by decades of repeated painting. The restoration project did not end the enthusiasm for the tradition. Students continue to paint and repaint the cannon to the present day. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
